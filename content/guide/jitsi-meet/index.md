Installing Jitsi Meet on your own server allows you to Voice-/Videochat with multiple people and use features like
screen sharing. Unlike other services it works without accounts or desktop clients â€” you just need to share a link with
others.

{{< alert type="warning" >}} This guide was written in March 2020 as there was no easy to follow guide at that time.
Since then Jitsi changed a lot and there is
now [a great self-hosting guide](https://jitsi.github.io/handbook/docs/devops-guide/devops-guide-quickstart). So this
page is just kept for reference. (but I still recommend using `certbot` for SSL instead)
{{< /alert >}}

## Prerequisites

- an up-to-date version of Ubuntu or Debian (tested using Ubuntu 18.04 and Debian Buster)
- a running instance of Apache or Nginx
- OpenJDK

## Adding the apt repository

{{< alert type="warning" >}} If you are using Ubuntu, make sure
the [universe repositories are enabled](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/Ubuntu)
{{< /alert >}}

The repository is added like ever other apt repository: Create `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/jitsi-stable.list` and enter the
following line in it:

```text
deb https://download.jitsi.org stable/
```

Afterwards add the GPG key with

```bash
wget -qO -  https://download.jitsi.org/jitsi-key.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
```

and update the repository with

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

## Add a firewall exception

If you are using `ufw` or another firewall software, you need to add an exception to the TCP ports 443 and 4443 and the
UDP port 10000:

```bash
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp # this is probably already allowed if you are runnning a webserver
sudo ufw allow 4443/tcp
sudo ufw allow 10000/udp
```

## Prepare the Let's Encrypt certificate

The easiest way to set up HTTPS is by creating the SSL certificates beforehand. If you are using `certbot` you can do
this by running e.g.

```bash
sudo certbot certonly -d jitsi.yourdomain.example
```

## Run the installer

At this point you can start the jitsi setup. At this point either Nginx or Apache have to be set up for the installer to
configure everything correctly.

```bash
apt-get -y install jitsi-meet
```

In the first step, the installer will ask for the domain where you want to install Jitsi: `jitsi.yourdomain.example`.

In the next step select that you want to use your existing certificate which you
created [in the previous step](/books/how-to-install-jitsi-meet-on-debian-or-ubuntu/page/prepare-the-lets-encrypt-certificate)
. Assuming you are using certbot, you can find the private key
at `/etc/letsencrypt/live/jitsi.yourdomain.example/privkey.pem` and the certificate
at `/etc/letsencrypt/live/jitsi.yourdomain.example/fullchain.pem`.

If all goes well you should already be able to access Jitsi at `https://jitsi.yourdomain.example`. Nevertheless, there
are a few more steps to make sure everything is configured ideally.

{{< alert type="danger" >}}
Everyone who can access the website is able to create a meeting room. If you want to
restrict this, follow the instructions [below](#adding-authentification-to-room-creation).

## Some more things...

### Nginx

If you are using Nginx, you can take a look at the generated `/etc/nginx/sites-available/jitsi.yourdomain.example.conf` and edit it to align with the configs of your other sites. You might want to adapt the ssl config or enable `http2`.

### NAT

If your server is not directly connected to the internet, you have to specify  its local IP in `/etc/jitsi/videobridge/sip-communicator.properties`:

```ini
org.ice4j.ice.harvest.NAT_HARVESTER_LOCAL_ADDRESS=<Local.IP.Address>
org.ice4j.ice.harvest.NAT_HARVESTER_PUBLIC_ADDRESS=<Public.IP.Address>
```

### STUN Server

(thanks to [kuketz-blog.de](https://www.kuketz-blog.de/kurzanleitung-jitsi-meet-videokonferenz-per-browser-oder-app/) for the idea)

By default Jitsi uses the STUN server by Google to set up a connection.
If you don't want this, you can replace the list of STUN servers in the `/etc/jitsi/meet/jitsi.yourdomain.example-config.js`:

```javascript
stunServers: [
    { urls: 'stun:stun.t-online.de:3478' },
    { urls: 'stun:stun.1und1.de:3478' }, 
    { urls: 'stun:stun.easybell.de:3478' },],
```


### Screensharing and Firefox 74+

**Update: This change is included in the latest version of the Debian package and is therefore not needed anymore.**

Screensharing in Firefox 74+ doesn't work. Thankfully there is a [patch available](https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/pull/5180) and it is simple enough that one can apply it to the installed Jitsi instance.

Edit the `/usr/share/jitsi-meet/libs/external_api.min.js`. It is minified and quite unreadable, but one only has to search for `camera; microphone;` in it and then replace the string `this._frame.allow="camera; microphone"` with `this._frame.allow="camera; microphone; display-capture"`.

A save and reload of the page later everything should be working fine.

## Adding authentification to room creation

You probably want to restrict the creation of new rooms to some users, but still allow everyone with the link to join a room.
For this we can configure [`jicofo`](https://github.com/jitsi/jicofo/blob/master/README.md#secure-domain):


{{< alert type="danger" >}}
You might also want to take a look at [the official docs](https://jitsi.github.io/handbook/docs/devops-guide/secure-domain) on this topic.
{{</alert>}}


First edit the `/etc/prosody/conf.avail/jitsi.yourdomain.example.cfg.lua`.
In the main `VirtualHost`, replace `anonymous` authentication with `internal_plain`. Next up create a new `VirtualHost` below for e.g. `guest.jitsi.yourdomain.example` with `anonymous` authentication.

Afterwards the file should look similar to this:

```lua
VirtualHost "jitsi.yourdomain.example"
        -- enabled = false -- Remove this line to enable this host
        authentication = "internal_plain"
        -- Properties below are modified by jitsi-meet-tokens package config
        -- and authentication above is switched to "token"
        --app_id="example_app_id"
        --app_secret="example_app_secret"
        -- Assign this host a certificate for TLS, otherwise it would use the one
        -- set in the global section (if any).
        -- Note that old-style SSL on port 5223 only supports one certificate, and will always
        -- use the global one.
        ssl = {
                key = "/etc/prosody/certs/jitsi.yourdomain.example.key";
                certificate = "/etc/prosody/certs/jitsi.yourdomain.example.crt";
        }
        -- we need bosh
        modules_enabled = {
            "bosh";
            "pubsub";
            "ping"; -- Enable mod_ping
        }

        c2s_require_encryption = false

VirtualHost "guest.jitsi.yourdomain.example"
    authentication = "anonymous"
    c2s_require_encryption = false
```
---
Next up, you have to edit the `config.js` at `/etc/jitsi/meet/jitsi.yourdomain.example-config.js`.

It should already have a line for `anonymousdomain` which you only need to uncomment and specify the domain of the new `VirtualHost`.

```js
var config = {
    hosts: {
        // XMPP domain.
        domain: 'jitsi.yourdomain.example',

        // When using authentication, domain for guest users.
        anonymousdomain: 'guest.jitsi.yourdomain.example',
      [...]
    }
}
```
----

Now we need to enable the authentification in `jicofo`. For this we create `/etc/jitsi/jicofo/sip-communicator.properties` and set it to
```ini
org.jitsi.jicofo.auth.URL=XMPP:jitsi.yourdomain.example
```
-----

After every config is set, we can restart `jicofo` and `prosody`

```bash
sudo systemctl restart prosody.service
sudo systemctl restart jicofo.service
```


------

And lastly we can create users using `prosodyctl`:
```bash
prosodyctl register <username> jitsi-meet.example.com <password>
```

-----

Now when you create a new room, you can click on `I am the host` and enter the username/passwort. Every following user will be able to join directly.

### Using existing user databases

As jitsi is using Prosody for this, you can use e.g. [IMAP](https://modules.prosody.im/mod_auth_imap.html), [LDAP](https://modules.prosody.im/mod_auth_ldap.html), [Wordpress](https://modules.prosody.im/mod_auth_wordpress.html) and [many more](https://modules.prosody.im/type_auth.html) for authentication.

But if you just want to limit the instance to the people you know, a single shared user account as set up above might be enough.
